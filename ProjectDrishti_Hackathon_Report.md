# Project Drishti: Agentic AI Usage & Hackathon Progress Report

---

## 1. Agentic AI & Google AI Technology Usage

### A. Vertex AI Vision
- **Where Used:**  
  - `drishti-mvp-functions/analyzeWithVertexVision.js`
- **How Used:**  
  - Every uploaded frame (from live webcam/mobile) is analyzed for person detection/count using Vertex AI Vision’s object localization API.
  - This is the primary perception layer for crowd analysis.

### B. Gemini (LLM, Multimodal)
- **Where Used:**  
  - `drishti-mvp-functions/analyzeWithGemini.js`
  - `drishti-mvp-functions/analyzeWithVertexVision.js` (calls Gemini after Vertex Vision)
- **How Used:**  
  - Each frame (and its person count) is sent to Gemini, which:
    - Assesses crowd density, smoke, fire, medical emergencies, and risk.
    - Recommends incident creation and action.
    - Provides structured, actionable output for the agent to act on.

### C. Agentic Role (Autonomous Action)
- **Where Used:**  
  - `drishti-mvp-functions/analyzeWithGemini.js`
  - `drishti-mvp-functions/analyzeWithVertexVision.js`
  - `drishti-mvp-functions/incidents-api.js`, `responders-api.js`
- **How Used:**  
  - The system autonomously:
    - Detects risks/incidents.
    - Creates incidents in Firestore.
    - Assigns responders and updates zone status.
    - Updates the dashboard and triggers alerts.

### D. Firebase Studio & Deployment
- **Where Used:**  
  - All backend functions are implemented as Firebase Functions.
  - Firestore is used for real-time data, incident, and zone management.
  - The frontend is integrated with Firebase for real-time updates.

## 2. Feature Coverage vs. Hackathon Objectives

| Feature/Objective | Implemented? | % Complete | Details |
|-------------------|--------------|------------|---------|
| **Predictive Bottleneck Analysis** | **Partially** | ~60% | Real-time crowd density and person count via Vertex AI Vision. Prediction logic (e.g., Vertex AI Forecasting for 15–20 min ahead) is not yet implemented, but the data pipeline is ready. |
| **AI-Powered Situational Summaries** | **Partially** | ~50% | Gemini can summarize risks per zone, but natural language querying and multi-source fusion (security reports, social media) are not yet fully implemented. |
| **Automate Intelligent Resource Dispatch** | **Yes** | 90% | When an incident is detected, the system auto-creates the incident and assigns the nearest available responder. Route optimization (Google Maps) is not yet integrated. |
| **Detect Multimodal Anomalies** | **Yes** | 90% | Gemini analyzes for smoke, fire, medical, and crowd surges in each frame. |
| **AI-Powered Lost & Found, Sentiment, Drone Dispatch** | **Not yet** | 0% | These are “go beyond” features and are not yet implemented. |
| **Firebase Studio & Deployment** | **Yes** | 100% | Project is built on Firebase Functions, Firestore, and deployed as required. |

## 3. Agentic AI: Are We Using It?
- **Agentic API/AI Usage:**  
  - **Vertex AI Vision:** 100% for perception.
  - **Gemini:** 100% for reasoning, risk, and incident recommendation.
  - **Agentic Automation:** 80–90% of the incident pipeline is autonomous (perception → reasoning → incident creation → responder assignment).
- **Vertex AI Agent Builder:**  
  - Not directly used as a conversational agent, but agentic logic is implemented via custom code and Gemini.

---

## 4. UI & Dashboard Integration
- **Live Camera Feed:**  
  - `src/components/CameraCapture.jsx` supports live streaming from webcam/mobile, uploading frames to the backend for analysis.
- **Real-Time Dashboard:**  
  - `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`, `src/components/dashboard/` display live risk, incident, and responder status.
- **Incident & Responder Management:**  
  - `src/components/incident/`, `src/components/incidents/` provide detailed incident and responder views.

---

## 5. Overall Progress Estimate
- **Agentic AI Usage:**  
  - **85–90%** of the backend pipeline is agentic and autonomous, using Google AI APIs.
- **Hackathon Objective Completion:**  
  - **Core objectives:** ~80% complete (perception, risk, incident, dispatch, dashboard).
  - **Advanced/“Go Beyond” features:** 0–10% (not yet started).

---

## 6. Recommendations for Final Push
- **Add Vertex AI Forecasting for true predictive bottleneck analysis.**
- **Integrate natural language querying for situational summaries (Gemini chat agent).**
- **Add “go beyond” features (Lost & Found, sentiment, drone dispatch) for bonus points.**
- **Polish UI for real-time risk and incident visualization.**
